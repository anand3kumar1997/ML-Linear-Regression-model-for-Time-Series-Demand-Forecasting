# Linear Regression model for Time Series Demand Forecasting

In this project the Linear Regression model is used to predict the future cars sales using historical car sales data.

A linear Regression develops a casual relationship between two or more variables. Regression models are highly useful because they are one of the most prevalent methods 
for drawing conclusions and making predictions.
It is the most basic and widely used type of regression analysis. It fits a regression line, which is a line of best fit that minimizes the gap between predicted values and the mean of observed values. This formula produces a line that reflects the shortest distance between a predicted and actual value for an independent variable. For all of these values, the purpose of linear regression is to minimize the total squared quantity. This is accomplished using the least squared method. such that error between each actual value points and regression line value points get minimized.


## Steps followed to forecast the sales

1. Time Series data Visualization (Reading and understanding the data)
2. Analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data
3. Splitting the data into training and test sets
4. Estimating the linear model (fitting the line)
5. Making predictions using the final model and evaluation
6. Evaluating the validity and usefulness of the model.
